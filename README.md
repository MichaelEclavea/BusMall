# BusMall
Lab: 11


This lab consisted of an array with multiple images. 
We created a Math.random() to cycle through the images, grabbing a random image to display. 

Next we also had to grab the element from the html and append to it a child element created in javascript.
The child element was created by manipulating the DOM. 

A constructor function was created to insert all the images from our array along with their path's and attributes. 

We included event listeners to the images to allow the user to pick 1 of 3.
the choice was then logged with if else statements and stored in an array. 

We also included JSON into javascript to store the information and display it again when the user is taken to the chart page.
